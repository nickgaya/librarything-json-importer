# librarything-json-importer

Selenium script to import JSON book data to LibraryThing.

## Setup

1. Install the [Selenium driver][1] for your browser of choice.

2. Create a Python 3 [virtual environment][2].

    python3 -m venv venv/

3. Install the Python requirements.

    venv/bin/pip install -U -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Import script

Execute `ltji.py` and specify the json file containing your book data.

    venv/bin/python3 ltji.py librarything_example.json

See `venv/bin/python3 ltji.py -h` for command-line options.

The script will open a new browser session to import the data. You will be
prompted to log in manually, after which the script will begin adding books to
your library.

If you set the `-c`/`--cookies` flag, the script will save cookies to file and
use them to bypass the login step on subsequent runs.

It is recommended to use the `-e`/`--errors` flag to record book ids that were
not imported successfully. This can be used to retry failures by re-running the
script with the `-i`/`--book-ids` flag.

### Export script

This project includes an optional script to enrich LibraryThing's JSON export
data with additional details used by the import script. The export script takes two positional arguments, an input book data file and an output file to write
the extra data collected.

    venv/bin/python3 ltje.py librarything_example.json extra.json

The output file can be provided as an additional argument to `ltji.py` when
importing.

Use the `-l`/`--login` value to enable user login. This enables access to
private book details. Login is also required to determine whether book covers
were chosen by the user or automatically assigned.

The export script collects the following information:

* **Order of secondary authors**. The native export functionality outputs the
  secondary authors in random order.

* **Book languages**. This will not affect import functionality except in some
  uncommon edge cases, *e.g.* specifying the same primary and secondary
  language.

* **Reading dates**. If there are multiple sets of reading dates, the native
  export only includes the most recent.

* **Lexile value**. This is not included in the native export for some reason.

* **Dewey decimal call number**. The native export includes this information,
  but does not indicate whether the value was autogenerated.

* **Summary autogenerated flag**. The native export does not indicate whether
  the summary was autogenerated or manually entered.

* **From where? details**. The native export records the value of this field
  but not whether it is a venue or free-text string.

* **Cover**. The native export does not indicate the selected cover.

## Known limitations

* Inventory status is not currently supported.

* The JSON data does not indicate whether books are private. To import all
  books as private, use the `-p`/`--private` flag.

* The JSON data does not specify pagination type so the script will attempt to
  guess based on the page count value (numbers, roman numerals, or "other").

* The JSON data only does not support more than one set of dimension values
  (width/height/thickness).

* The JSON data does not indicate whether the Summary and Physical description
  fields have been set manually. By default the script leaves these fields
  blank to allow LibraryThing to auto-generate values. You can use the
  `--summary` and `--physical-summary` flags to change this behavior. (Note:
  the export script is able to detect the autogenerated status of the summary
  field, but not physical summary.)

* Physical description cannot be specified when adding a new book using the
  manual entry form.

* The process for adding data from sources is somewhat rough and has a chance
  to select an incorrect work. To add all books manually use the
  `-s`/`--no-source` flag. Note that manually added books will not have EAN,
  UPC, ASIN, LCCN, or OCLC values, as these values cannot be entered manually.

* The script has only been tested with Firefox, so there may be unknown issues
  with other browsers.
